# Copilot Coding Agent Instructions

## Base branch
- Always branch off from `dev` (not `master`).

## Branch naming
- When starting work on an issue, create a new branch from `dev`.
- The branch name must follow this format:
- `<issue-number>` = GitHub issue number.
- `<issue-title>` = lowercase, kebab-case (spaces â†’ `-`, remove punctuation).
- Example: For issue #42 "Fix login bug", branch should be:
  ```
  42-fix-login-bug
  ```

## Commits
- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
- `feat: <message>` for new features
- `fix: <message>` for bug fixes
- `docs: <message>` for documentation changes
- `refactor: <message>` for code refactors
- `test: <message>` for test-related changes
- `chore: <message>` for build/tooling/maintenance
- Messages should be concise but descriptive.

## Pull Requests
- Open a draft PR against `dev`.
- PR title should match the first commit message.
- Add "Closes #<issue-number>" in the PR description.
